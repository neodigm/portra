## Portra

### Requirements
Portra uses the Python XMP Toolkit, which requires Exempi 2.2.0 or higher to be installed on your system. Refer to the Python XMP Toolkit [documentation](https://python-xmp-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for further information.

### Overview
Portra is a simple Flask app that allows you to view and download XMP metadata stored in an image, which includes Adobe Lightroom develop settings.

A command line tool `portracl` is also provided that provides the same functionality from the command line.
